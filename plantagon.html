				<p>Plantagon is a home farm designed for those who are eager to learn how to grow their own food. Plantagon aims to enable people who live in homes without exterior space to grow different types of fruit and vegetables indoor and to educate amateur gardeners on how to grow plants. In the time and age where technology is prevalent in everyday life, Plantagon brings in technology yet uses it as an aid for learning and promote the interaction between human and technology. It also uses module system to accommodate different homes and environment, as well as encouraging people to learn.</p>

			<h2 class="subtitle">MODULE SYSTEM</h2>
			<p>The module system allows flexibility in the environment Plantagon is implemented. You can choose how many modules to attach based on the space your home has, and how many plants you want to grow.</p>

		<div class="function">

			<span> <hr noshade /></span>
			<h3>LOCKING MECHANISM</h3>
			<p>The hanger is nailed to the wall, while the modules and the main hub slide in to the hanger. The modules are powered through the main hub. Each module comes with sensors to monitor how the plants are doing and relay that information to you through the main hub.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="top introtext detail">
			<h2 class="subtitle">LEARN HOW TO GROW PLANTS</h2>
			<p>Plantagon is a system that educates people on how to grow plants; it doesn't grow your plants for you. By using sensors, Plantagon would understand how the plants are doing and relay that information to you through the main hub, and you can then act accordingly.</p>
